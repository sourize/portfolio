Customer reviews are a goldmine for businesses, offering insights into customer satisfaction and areas of improvement. However, analyzing large volumes of reviews manually can be time-consuming. That’s where **sentiment analysis** comes in. I developed a **Natural Language Processing (NLP) model** to classify restaurant reviews as either positive or negative, enabling businesses to quickly assess customer feedback.

## Key Steps and Methodologies

### 1. Dataset Preparation

The first step was to collect and prepare the restaurant review dataset. This dataset contained a variety of reviews, both positive and negative.

- **Data Cleaning:** Raw text data often contains noise, such as special characters, punctuation, and unnecessary words. I performed extensive cleaning to ensure the dataset was of high quality. This included:
  - Removing punctuation and special characters.
  - Converting text to lowercase for uniformity.
  - Eliminating stop words (like "the," "and," "but") that don’t contribute to sentiment.

### 2. Feature Extraction

Next, I converted the cleaned text into numerical data that a machine learning model could process.

- **Bag of Words (BoW) Model:** I used the **Bag of Words** model to transform text into a structured, numerical format. BoW works by creating a vocabulary of all the unique words in the dataset and then representing each review as a vector based on the word frequency.
  - This feature extraction method enabled the machine learning model to understand the content of the reviews in a simplified, quantifiable format.

### 3. Model Training

For sentiment classification, I chose the **Naive Bayes algorithm**, which is highly effective for text-based classification tasks.

- **Naive Bayes Algorithm:** It assumes that the features (in this case, words) are independent, making it computationally efficient for large datasets.
  - I trained the model using the BoW-transformed dataset, where the model learned the relationship between word patterns and sentiment (positive or negative).

### 4. Model Evaluation

Once the model was trained, I tested its performance on a separate test dataset.

- **Accuracy:** The model achieved an accuracy of **73%**, which is a solid result for sentiment analysis, especially for a simple Bag of Words representation. This accuracy indicates that the model can reliably classify the sentiment of customer reviews, providing valuable insights into customer opinions.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Python:** The programming language used for all data processing and model training tasks.
- **Scikit-Learn:** This library was used for machine learning implementation, including the Naive Bayes algorithm and the Bag of Words model.
- **Pandas and Numpy:** Essential libraries for data manipulation, preprocessing, and handling large datasets efficiently.

## Outcome

The **Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis Model** successfully classifies customer reviews as either positive or negative, achieving a reliable accuracy rate of 73%. This project demonstrates my proficiency in working with **text data, performing data preprocessing**, and implementing machine learning algorithms for sentiment analysis.

This model provides businesses with an automated way to analyze customer feedback, helping them identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. The application of sentiment analysis in this project showcases the power of NLP and machine learning in real-world problem-solving.

## Conclusion

By developing this model, I’ve showcased my expertise in **Natural Language Processing, machine learning,** and the ability to build practical solutions that can help businesses understand customer sentiment. With further optimization, the model could be fine-tuned to achieve even higher accuracy and potentially be adapted for other domains, like product reviews or social media sentiment analysis.
