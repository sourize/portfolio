I developed a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to classify restaurant reviews as either positive or negative, showcasing my skills in handling text data, preprocessing, and machine learning for sentiment analysis.

### Key Steps and Methodologies:
1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - Used a dataset of customer restaurant reviews.
   - Performed extensive data cleaning to remove noise and improve input quality.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Applied the Bag of Words model to convert text into numerical features for machine learning algorithms.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Utilized the Naive Bayes algorithm for text classification, trained on the extracted features.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Achieved 73% accuracy on the test dataset, demonstrating reliable sentiment prediction.

### Technologies and Tools:
- Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy

### Outcome:
The model accurately classifies reviews, providing businesses with valuable insights into customer feedback. This project highlights my expertise in NLP, data preprocessing, and machine learning.
