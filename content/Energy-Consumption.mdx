Energy consumption is a critical aspect of facility management, sustainability, and cost control. Understanding and predicting energy usage patterns allows organizations to optimize consumption and reduce waste. This blog post walks you through an **Energy Consumption Prediction Model** that uses various factors such as building type, area, utility data, and solar usage to forecast energy demands. By employing machine learning techniques, this model offers actionable insights for improving energy efficiency.

## Project Overview
The dataset used in this model contains features like site name, department, electric utility, building type, address, year, solar usage, peak electric demand, and more. The target variable is energy consumption, which we aim to predict based on these factors. We employed a **Random Forest Regressor** for this task due to its effectiveness in handling structured data with multiple features.

## Steps Involved

### 1. Data Preprocessing
Effective data preprocessing is key to developing a reliable model. Here’s how we approached it:
- **Libraries Imported:** We used **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **numpy** for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Dataset Loaded:** After loading the dataset, we selected the relevant columns that had the most impact on energy consumption.
- **Handling Missing Values:** Any rows with null values were dropped to ensure data consistency. This step was crucial for avoiding skewed model results.
- **Feature Selection:** We identified relevant features (such as building area, solar usage, and peak electric demand) and separated them from the target variable (energy consumption).

### 2. Encoding Categorical Features
The dataset contained categorical variables such as **site name**, **electric utility**, and **building type**, which needed to be transformed into numerical values for the model to process. We applied **label encoding** to these columns to convert categorical data into numerical form.

### 3. Splitting the Data
We split the dataset into two parts:
- **Training Set (80%):** Used to train the model.
- **Test Set (20%):** Used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
This 80-20 split ensured that enough data was available for both training and testing while minimizing overfitting.

### 4. Training the Model
The machine learning algorithm chosen was **Random Forest Regressor**, which is well-suited for regression tasks due to its ability to handle a large number of input features.
- **Parameters:** We used **1007 estimators** (trees) and set a **random state of 17** to maintain consistency and reproducibility of results.
- The model was trained on the training data, learning the relationships between the various features and energy consumption.

### 5. Model Evaluation
Once the model was trained, we predicted energy consumption on the test dataset. The evaluation metric used was the **R² score**, which measures the model's accuracy by indicating how well the predicted values match the actual data.
- **R² Score:** The model achieved an accuracy of approximately **77.92%**, reflecting its strong predictive power.
- **Insights:** The model effectively captured the relationship between factors such as building type, solar usage, and peak electric demand, making it a valuable tool for forecasting energy needs.

## Key Takeaways
This model provides valuable insights for energy management:
- **Energy Optimization:** The ability to predict future energy consumption based on various features allows businesses to implement better energy-saving strategies.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** The model’s accuracy empowers decision-makers to anticipate energy demands and adjust their operational strategies accordingly.
- **Scalability:** With a well-structured dataset and the Random Forest model, the prediction model can be applied to various other sites or departments for broader use.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** The programming language used for data processing and model training.
- **Pandas & Numpy:** Essential libraries for handling and manipulating data efficiently.
- **Matplotlib:** Used for visualizing relationships and patterns in the data.
- **Random Forest Regressor:** The machine learning algorithm selected for its reliability in regression tasks involving multiple features.

## Conclusion
The Energy Consumption Model successfully predicts energy usage with an accuracy of 77.92%, offering significant value to energy managers and decision-makers. By identifying the key drivers of energy consumption and making informed predictions, this model provides a practical approach to optimizing energy usage and minimizing costs.
