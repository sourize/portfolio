The road to the Smart India Hackathon (SIH) began with a whirlwind of brainstorming sessions and a daunting list of potential problem statements. Our team found ourselves in a maze of possibilities, initially gravitating towards a few ideas but later realizing they didn’t quite click. After discarding a few options, we finally landed on a topic that aligned perfectly with our skills and interests—Oil Spill Detection using AIS Data and Satellite Images.

## Forming the Team
We formed a diverse team of six, each member bringing unique strengths to the table. I took on the responsibility of building the machine learning (ML) model using AIS data, along with one other teammate. Two other members focused on developing the model for satellite image analysis, a crucial aspect of our solution. Our team leader and the sixth member were dedicated to refining the presentation (PPT) and ensuring our ideas were communicated effectively.

## Building the Models
The core of our project revolved around building two machine learning models: one for analyzing the AIS (Automatic Identification System) dataset, which tracks the movements of ships, and the other for processing satellite images to detect oil spills visually.

Our approach combined my expertise in Python and Machine learning with the team's collective knowledge in different areas, including backend development, research work, and data science.

## Preparing for the First Screening
With our project idea locked in and our team roles clearly defined, we worked tirelessly on creating a prototype of the machine learning models and polishing our presentation. We knew the competition was tough, as 102 teams were competing for a spot in the internal hackathon.

_Finally, the day came when the initial screening results were announced. Out of the 102 teams, only 65 were selected and we were among them!_

## The Internal Round
For the internal hackathon, we needed to take our project to the next level. We improved our PPT and further refined our models to be more presentable to the judges. Tensions were high on the day of the internal hackathon. Our team leader led the presentation while we all supported by answering the judges’ questions and explaining our approach in detail. Despite the nerves, we delivered a strong performance.

## The Moment of Success
Three days later, on Monday, September 10th, we received the much-awaited news: we had qualified from the internal round! The sense of accomplishment was immense, but we knew this was just the beginning.

Now, our focus shifts to preparing for the main SIH event. We will continue to enhance our models, fine-tune our presentation, and aim for the ultimate goal—winning the Smart India Hackathon.

_Our journey so far has been filled with challenges, learning experiences, and teamwork. As we move forward, I’m confident that with dedication and perseverance, we will be ready for whatever comes next._
