This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict real estate prices based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The model uses advanced data preprocessing and machine learning techniques to provide accurate predictions, helping buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals make informed decisions.

### Key Features:
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Collected data from real estate listings and public records.
   - Cleaned the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
   - Applied One-Hot Encoding to convert categorical variables into a machine-learning-friendly format.

2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Focused on key predictors: square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.

3. **Model Selection and Training**:
   - Utilized the Random Forest Regressor, an ensemble method that combines decision trees to improve accuracy.
   - Trained and fine-tuned the model on a split training and testing dataset.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Assessed performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) metrics.
   - Achieved high accuracy, with strong correlation between predicted and actual prices.

### Technologies and Tools:
- Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Random Forest Regressor for modeling
- Data preprocessing via One-Hot Encoding and data cleaning

### Conclusion:
The model accurately predicts house prices based on key features, offering valuable insights for real estate market stakeholders. This project demonstrates effective use of data preprocessing and machine learning to address real-world challenges.
