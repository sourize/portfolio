## 🧠 Who is Sourish?

I'm a tech enthusiast with a deep passion for AI and ML. My journey began at Ram Mohan Mission High School, where my curiosity for technology first took root. It blossomed into a full-fledged passion at DPS Ruby Park as I delved into the world of Computer Science.

### 💡 Why AI & ML?

It all started with a spark—a fascination with how technology could unlock the mysteries of the universe, inspired by the genius of _Tony Stark_. Today, I channel that spark into:

- Crafting models that push the boundaries of Artificial Intelligence
- Predicting [stock markets](/posts/2024/05/TheNifty50StockPredictionUsingMachineLearning/)
- [Evolving game AI](/posts/2024/07/AIPoweredFlappyBirdGameUsingNEATAlgorithm/)

## 🔧 My Toolkit

- **AI/ML Wizardry**: Bringing ideas to life using neural networks, random forests, and other ML models. Python is my go-to language.

- **Data Whisperer**: Transforming raw data into actionable insights with Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib.

- **Team Player**: Collaborating effectively through internships, hackathons, and group projects.
